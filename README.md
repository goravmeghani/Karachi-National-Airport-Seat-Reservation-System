# ✈️ Karachi National Airport Seat Reservation System (Python)

This project is special to me — it was my **first Python project**, and it holds a close place in my journey as a developer. What started as an experiment with basic programming concepts turned into a complete system where I combined **logic, creativity, and problem-solving** to simulate a real-world flight seat reservation experience.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The **Karachi National Airport Seat Reservation System** is a Python-based console application that allows users to:

* Sign up and log in with email/password validation.
* Book seats for flights from Karachi to **Islamabad, Multan, and Lahore** (morning & night shifts).
* View seat availability dynamically and select specific seats.
* Get a generated **receipt** with details like name, email, flight, seats, and price.
* Admins can log in to view customer data, manage seat allocations, and add new admin accounts.

It’s not just a project — it was the first time I felt the power of programming in solving practical problems.

## 🔑 Features

* ✅ User Authentication (Signup & Login with regex validation)
* ✅ Seat Reservation with real-time updates
* ✅ Price calculation based on destination and seats booked
* ✅ Admin & Chief Admin panels for advanced management
* ✅ Data storage using file handling (`emails` file)
* ✅ Receipt generation for passengers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Core Concepts Used:**

  * File handling
  * Regular expressions
  * Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
  * User input validation
  * Role-based access (User/Admin)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-reservation-system.git
   cd flight-reservation-system
   ```
2. Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.
3. Run the project:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📷 Screenshots (Optional)

*(Add CLI screenshots here once you run the project, e.g. seat booking interface, login screen, receipt output.)*

## 💡 Lessons & Reflections

This project was more than just writing code — it was my **first real step into software development**. I learned how to:

* Break down a big idea into smaller, manageable pieces.
* Handle user data and think about **security**.
* Simulate real-world processes like booking and administration.
* Most importantly: I experienced the joy of seeing an idea come alive through code.

That sense of achievement — when I saw my first working receipt being printed — is something I’ll always remember 💙.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add a database instead of file storage.
* Improve the interface with a GUI or web-based front end.
* Add more destinations and flexible pricing.
